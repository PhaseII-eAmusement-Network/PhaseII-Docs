# Content Creation Guidelines
## Streaming
- Public streaming is allowed for cabinets only
> If we catch you streaming from a controller outside of private or unlisted streams, it's an instant ban.

## Preservation
- Use Incognito Mode to preserve default game values

## Incognito Mode
You have the ability to mask the network in-game with Incognito Mode. You can enable this in your arcade's control panel.
When put into Incognito Mode, the server URL and ranking data will not be loaded. We'll use default values for any sensitive information.
> If you're catering to a larger audience via streaming or content creation, we suggest using Incognito Mode.
