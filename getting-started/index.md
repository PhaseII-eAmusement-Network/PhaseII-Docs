# Getting Started
This guide aims to get you up and running with PhaseII, wether you're a cabinet owner, setup/controller user, or just a player. Please take note of the dedicated sections.

## Running a Game?
Eventually, you'll need to follow the guide below, but please follow the connection guide to get started.
Proceed to [Getting Connected](/getting-started/connecting)

## As a Player
If you've played at an arcade, event, or home setup connected to PhaseII, proceed with this guide. This assumes you have already created a PIN on the network using your card.

1. **Log your Access Code**
- On the login screen of a game, you're provided an Access Code. Please take note of it as we'll need it for account creation.
> *Some games (SOUND VOLTEX) will hide parts of the access code with "XXXX" and require that you press a button or open a menu to view the entire code.*

2. **Finish your first game**
- You'll want to let the profile sign out before continuing. This is important as your game profile won't have any real data until you're fully signed out.

3. **Claim your Account**
- Proceed to the WebUI with your Access Code and Login PIN to finish creating your account.
  - [Old WebUI](https://phaseii.network/register){:target="_blank"}
  - [Beta WebUI V3](https://web3.phaseii.network/#/auth/register){:target="_blank"}
> *You can use either WebUI for this step but we recommend WebUI V3.*

That's all there is to setting up your account. Enjoy!
