# Joining the Discord server
Invite links are shared by members or private forums. No links are to be shared publicly outside of small communities.

After joining the PhaseII eAmusement Network Discord server, you will be greeted with a message from **BadManiac**, our bot.
> Please make sure that you allow direct messages from BadManiac if you would like to use the notification system.

After reading the rules and guides, you will need to write a greeting message to gain access to the server.
In this greeting, you will need to specify the following:
- What game(s) you play
- What you're connecting with
  > Please note that keyboard play is not allowed.
- The secret code (somewhere in these guides!)
- Why you're wanting to use PhaseII
- Any feature suggestions you might have

Once a moderator reads your greeting, roles will be applied to your account and you will be able to access the rest of the Discord server.
