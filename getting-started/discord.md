# Discord
PhaseII has a first party Discord Server, which is the primary location for updates, news, and troubleshooting.

## Joining the Discord server
Invite links are shared by members or private forums. No links are to be shared publicly outside of small communities.

After joining the PhaseII eAmusement Network Discord server, you will be greeted with a message from **BadManiac**, our bot.
> Please make sure that you allow direct messages from BadManiac as they are required for the notification system.

After reading the rules and guides, you will need to submit the secret code (somewhere in here) with `/submit-greeting`

Once you submit your greeting, you'll recieve the `Player` role. This will give you access to the rest of the Discord server.

In the `#getting-started` channel, you can apply game notification roles and other visual roles via reactions.

## BadManiac
BadManiac is the bot powering PhaseII's integrations with our Discord Server. You'll interact with this bot for your greeting and requesting a PCBID.

**If you ever recieve communications from BadManiac, please ensure that the bot is actually BadManiac!** BadManiac's official information is as follows:
- Full name: `BadManiac#5743`
- App ID: `928550369859108904`
- Member of: `PhaseII eAmusement Network`

Additionally, please ensure that you have direct messages enabled for BadManiac *before* requesting a PCBID. The generation will send you an automated direct message once the arcade is approved.

## Linking Discord to PhaseII
You can unlock extra features by linking your Discord and PhaseII accounts. You're able to easily do so via the WebUI.
- [Old WebUI](https://phaseii.network/account){:target="_blank"}
- [Beta WebUI V3](https://web3.phaseii.network/#/profile/integrate){:target="_blank"}
> *You can use either WebUI for this step but we recommend WebUI V3.*

PhaseII *does not* use Discord's API aside from the initial linkage. All data PhaseII uses is sent via BadManiac. No data aside from your avatar, User ID, and name is saved. We do not save a token nor a cookie.

Here's a full list of the features that linking provides:
- Account verification
- WebUI account avatar and special role tags
- Push notifications for error logs, account logs, play videos, and more
- Scorecards sent from a game
